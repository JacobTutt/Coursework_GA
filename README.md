# Galactic Archeology Project

This project:
- Uses Gaia to construct an all-sky Gaia map of the Milky Way's halo substructures.
- Identifies overdensities (Globuluar Glusters and satellite galaxies) using automated detection
- Detects stellar streams using Integral of Motion space
- Includes metallicity comparisons with APOGEE DR17 to understand stellar evolution.
